# expsyling_e22
instructor repo for expsyling at AU, fall '22

nbs: the notebooks created.
- clean usually means post-livecoding in-class
- filled usually means it contains live-coding notes (i.e., for my eyes only)

html: the html-files created based on the nbs
- just because that is better for uploading to brightspace
- not all nbs are html
