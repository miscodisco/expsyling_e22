That means there is a financial incentive for brewers to get the foam just right every time, and that means: science! Below, you can read the abstract from a study by Ault et al (1967), who devised a means to measure beer head retention (how much foam there is, how long it lasts, and how much it sticks to the glass) in a way that would as closely as possible mimic the consumer's experience."
